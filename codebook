Source Data Overview

The source data used in this project comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A comprehensive description of the dataset can be found at: Human Activity Recognition Data Set. You can download the dataset here: Download Link.

R Script Explanation

The run_analysis.R script prepares the data and performs the five necessary steps as outlined in the course project requirements.

Download the dataset.

Assign data to variables:
features <- features.txt: This file contains the selected features from the accelerometer and gyroscope's 3-axial raw signals (tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ).
activities <- activity_labels.txt: This file lists the activities associated with the corresponding measurements and their respective codes (labels).
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt: This file contains test data from 9 out of 30 volunteer subjects.
x_test <- test/X_test.txt: This file contains the recorded test data features.
y_test <- test/y_test.txt: This file holds the activity code labels for the test data.
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt: This file contains training data from 21 out of 30 volunteer subjects.
x_train <- test/X_train.txt: This file contains the recorded training data features.
y_train <- test/y_train.txt: This file holds the activity code labels for the training data.

Merge the training and test sets to create a single dataset:
X is created by merging x_train and x_test using the rbind() function.
Y is created by merging y_train and y_test using the rbind() function.
Subject is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using the rbind() function.
Merged_Data is then created by combining Subject, Y, and X using the cbind() function.

Extract only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation:
TidyData is created by subsetting Merged_Data and selecting only the columns related to subject, activity code, and the mean and standard deviation measurements for each variable.

Replace activity codes with descriptive names:
The activity codes in the code column of TidyData are replaced with the corresponding activity names from the activities variable.

Label the dataset with descriptive variable names:
The code column is renamed to activities.
The term Acc in column names is replaced by Accelerometer.
The term Gyro in column names is replaced by Gyroscope.
The term BodyBody in column names is replaced by Body.
The term Mag in column names is replaced by Magnitude.
Any column name starting with f is replaced by Frequency.
Any column name starting with t is replaced by Time.

Create a second tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject:
FinalData is created by summarizing TidyData, calculating the means of each variable for each subject and activity, after grouping by both subject and activity.
The FinalData is exported as a FinalTidyData.txt file.
