The "Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project" includes R code, a codebook, and the FinalTidyData text file for the peer-reviewed assignment.

Files:

CodeBook.md provides instructions on how to use the materials, explains the variables and data, and details any transformations or operations performed to clean the data.

run_analysis.R contains the code to complete the analysis following these 5 steps:

Merges the training and test datasets to create a single dataset.

Extracts only the measurements related to the mean and standard deviation for each variable.

Applies descriptive activity names to label the activities in the dataset.

Appropriately labels the dataset with meaningful variable names.

Creates a second independent tidy dataset, which averages each variable for each activity and subject from the data in step 4.

FinalTidyData.txt is the result from the final step.
